# World-Cup-Bowling-Data-Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of World Cup bowling data obtained from a dataset in CSV format. The focus is on extracting valuable insights from the performances of the top bowlers and teams during the tournament. The analysis is conducted using Python programming language within a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for efficient data manipulation, numerical operations, and visualization.

# Tools Used

    Python: Primary programming language for data analysis.
    Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code execution, data visualization, and analysis.
    Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: Library for numerical operations and array manipulation.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations.

# Analysis Steps

    Data Loading: The initial step involves loading the World Cup bowling dataset from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

    Data Cleaning: The dataset is examined for missing values, inconsistencies, and any other data quality issues. Cleaning processes are implemented to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A thorough exploration of the dataset is conducted to understand its structure, summary statistics, and initial insights. This phase involves gaining an overview of the top bowlers and teams' performances.

    Data Visualization: Visualizations are created to illustrate various aspects of the bowling data, such as line plots for overs bowled, bar charts for highest runs given, run rates, wides, maidens, and more. Visualizations will aid in presenting trends and patterns effectively.

# Conclusion

The World Cup bowling data analysis project uncovers essential insights into the performances of bowlers and teams during the tournament. This information can serve as a basis for strategic decisions, player evaluations, and team planning, contributing to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the bowling aspect in World Cup cricket.
